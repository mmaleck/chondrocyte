## Description
Model of the fundamental electrophysiological characteristics of human articular chondrocytes, focused on K+ selective ion channels and ion pumps, but also including the contributions of Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ on the chondrocyte membrane potential (Em). 

## Installation

The following python modules are needed to use chondrocyte, 

* NumPy (developed with Version: 1.18.1)
* SciPy (developed with Version: 1.6.0)
* Matplotlib (developed with Version: 3.4.1)

To use chondrocyte, please clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mmaleck/chondrocyte.git
cd chondrocyte
```

## Usage

chondrocyte was originally developed with MATLAB and can be found in the [matlab_code](matlab_code) folder. It has been reimplemented in python with some improvements and model expansions.
Therefore, we encourage users to use [python_code](python_code), and also we only write instructions on how to use chondrocyte in python for that matter. 

Inside [python_code](python_code), there are four python files, `chondrocyte.py`, `functions.py`, `params.py`, `modelpopulations.py`, and `postprocess.py` in addition to four jupyter notebooks `demo_*.ipynb`. 

These jupyter notebooks are examples of how to use the chondrocyte interactively, and the demos include replications of figures from the published papers. 

`chondrocyte.py` is the core part of the chondrocyte model. 
It imports necessary functions from `functions.py` and parameters from `params.py` to execute the program, and `postprocess.py` demonstrates one way to process the results. `modelpopulations.py` illustrates how to use population of models to explore high dimension parameter space. 

For detailed instructions about the code, we ask users to have a look at the code as it contains the explanation as comments.
